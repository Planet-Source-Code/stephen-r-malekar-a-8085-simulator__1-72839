MVI C, 08H 	; Initialize count with 8
Back: MOV A,B 	;
RRC		; Rotate B register contents right
MOV B,A 	; Save contents of register B 
JNC skip 	; If no carry skip
MVI A,0C0H 
SIM 		; If carry, send high on SOD 
JMP NEXT
SKIP: MVI A,40H
SIM 		; If no carry, send low on SOD
; This is a simulation therefore real time delay is skipped 
NEXT: DCR C 	; Decrement count by 1
JNZ Back 	; if count=0 ,if not repeat 
HLT 		; Stop program execution
